Scripts to preprocess immune repertoire sequencing reads.  These are associated with Horns et al. 2016 Elife.  The workflow is: (1) find the molecular barcode in each read and put reads with the same molecular barcode together, (2) determine the consensus read for each molecular barcode, (3) combine identical sequences to count molecular abundance, (4) run IgBlast to annotate the sequences with features such as germline V and J gene usage, and (5) run Blast against a custom database of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region sequences to determine isotype.  Input consists of fastq files of paired end sequencing reads.  Output files and intermediate files are created in the same directory as the input files.  Note that in order to run these scripts, one must create a configuration file.  An example is provided (config.json).  This script is configured to run in a distributed computing cluster using Slurm.  An example of a submission script is provided (run_igh_preprocess.sh).
