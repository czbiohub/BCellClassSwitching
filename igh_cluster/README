Scripts to find clonal lineages (clusters) of immunoglobulin heavy chain sequences.  These are associated with Horns et al. 2016 Elife.  The workflow is: (1) find groups consisting of sequences which have the same V and J germline gene, and the same CDR3 length, (2) within each group, find sequences belonging to the same clonal lineage using single linkage clustering.  Input consists of a seedfile which specifies the paths to the sequences to be clustered, the clustering parameters (i.e. cutoff identity for single linkage clustering), and the path to the output directory.  The input sequencs are in the output format of igh_preprocess.  An example is provided (seedfile.txt).  Note that in order to run these scripts, one must create a configuration file.  An example is provided (config.json).  This script is configured to run in a distributed computing cluster using Slurm.  An example of a submission script is provided (run_igh_cluster.sh).
