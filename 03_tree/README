Scripts to reconstruct history of clonal lineages.  These are associated with Horns et al. 2016 Elife.  The workflow is: (1) perform a multiple sequence alignment of the sequences in a clonal lineage by aligning known anchor points (start and end of CDR3), (2) get the germline V and J gene sequences for the clonal lineage and concatenate them, (3) align the germline to the rest of the lineages using a profile-profile alignment using MUSCLE, and (4) find a minimum spanning tree (MST) for the lineages using substitutions between sequences as the distance metric.  Input consists of a seedfile which specifies the path to the output directory for the MSTs.  An example is provided (seedfile.txt).  Note that in order to run these scripts, one must create a configuration file.  An example is provided (config.json).  This script is configured to run in a distributed computing cluster using Slurm.  An example of a submission script is provided (run.sh).
